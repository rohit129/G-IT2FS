## Objectives:
* To construct **Gaussian IT2FS with uncertain mean** using hybrid approach.
* To build an application using the above IT2FS in solving MADM problem.
* MADM problem chosen to select the suggest the suitable **Online Study Platform (OSP)** from the set of alternatives given student's preferences.

## How to run (Code is build on MATLAB R2018b):
```
Run the file "g_osp_comparison.m" on MATLAB-GUI.
```

## Output Figures:
* "Codebook_Membership_functions.eps" : Shows the Codebook (**Gaussian IT2FSs with uncertain mean** membership functions) needed in OSP selection based MADM problem.
* "Linguistic_Ratings of Different OSPs" : Shows the Linguistic_Ratings corresponding to each OSP.
* "Linguistic_Weights_for_students.eps" : Shows the Linguistic weights of the student in the weight vector.
* "LWA_Ouput_of_student_for_different_OSPs": Shows the LWA output of the student corresponding to each OSP.
* "Output_similarity.eps" : Shows best recommendation word to LWA ouput using Jaccard Similarity.
